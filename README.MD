I created a command-line Student Gradebook System using Java to demonstrate key language features including classes, objects, loops, conditionals, and file I/O. The program allows users to add students, assign grades, calculate average scores, and identify underperforming students. It also implements data persistence by saving and loading student records using Javaâ€™s built-in serialization system.

The purpose of this software was to deepen my understanding of Java and create a simple, interactive way to manage students and calculate average grades in an efficient and engaging format.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I developed the software using Visual Studio Code on a macOS
The programming language used was Java Version "24.0.1"
